## Usage

Once configured, you can use natural language with your AI assistant:

### Common Usage Patterns

**Examples**:

1. `can you call search the docs on how to use "contact" objects ?`
2. `Explain amp.tools.stopTimeout and its default in the docs of ampcode. use docs tool`

### Quick Start Flow

1. **Link to your scope** (optional): Use `link` tool to associate with a user or team. Default scope is 'user'.
2. **Check available docs**: Use `list-docs` to see what documentation is available in your current scope.
3. **Search documentation**: Use `search-docs` with the index name, your query, and optional result count.
4. **Create new indices** (if needed): Use `index` tool to index a new documentation source if not already present.

> Tip: Use the base documentation URL (https://supabase.com/docs) instead of an inner link (https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/dependencies)

## Tips for Best Results
